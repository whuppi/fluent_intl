# make hooks    Activate the repo's git hooks (commit-msg, pre-commit).
#               Run once after cloning — they stay dormant otherwise.
#               Idempotent. The hooks live at the repo root
#               (.githooks/), stamped from the shared whuppi set.

#                 snapshots the GIT REPO, and the fluent_bundle path dep lives

#                 published. Activates when the family deps go hosted — the
#                 release checklist flips it into `check`.
